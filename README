This project is a simple Java implementation, providing a solution to the problem "How Big is the Webpage", described below.

Approach taken:

1) Sketch design, separating the basic concerns of UI, parallel processing, HTTP retrieval and size calculation.

2) Create Eclipse project and code framework.

3) Create unit tests and implementation.  Start with service layer and work down, and finish with UI (the UI having already been specified in the problem description).

4) Perform acceptance testing.

Run the WebSize class (in Eclipse for ease) and enter addresses on the console, followed by "-1".

How Big is the Webpage?

Create a program to calculate the number of bytes required to store the responses from a number of webpages. There is a constraint for the maximum execution time allowed so you will need to process each of the websites simultaneously. The total time allowed for the program to execute is 1,500ms.

The input will contain a list of websites addresses without the http:// prefix. The number of webpages supplied in the input can be of any length and will be terminated by a -1.

Each line of the output will be the webpage address followed by a space and then the number of bytes in the response. If there was an error connecting to the site or the site didn't return a response in the time allowed output a asterisk (*) as a place holder for the webpage size.

The output can be in any order and needn't match the order of the websites provided in the input. The output will be terminated with a -1 when the execution is complete.
